/*****************************

  - Shark Bait: Dead in the Water -

  Client [and test server] portion of a class project for CIS*3750
  at the University of Guelph, Fall of 2011.

  Shark Bait is a 2d, top-down naval combat "simulator".
  We made a lot of mistakes, correct some of them, and ended up with
  a pretty rad product that we are quite proud of, considering the
  tight timeframe that development took place in [~2 weeks for dev
  and testing, with some documentation and packaging taking place
  at the end of the term].
  
  As we only have a test server – not one of the server groups'
  product – all you can really do with this game is script basic
  movements and weather/state changes in the world.

  We offer this to you, The World, to appreciate, to enjoy, and to judge.
  Please don't be too harsh.
